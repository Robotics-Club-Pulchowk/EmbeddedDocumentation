Basic Tutorial
==============

In this **Embedded Tutorial**, you will learn about **Embedded programming**, **Kinematics**, **Control Algorithm**, **filters**, **error detection and correction**, some useful maths and other many things. There are lots of topic to learn in this subject. Being interested in **Electronics**, it is essential to have knowledge about it.

For this tutorial, we are using **STM32F407VGT6** microcontroller used in ``STM32F407VG-DISC1`` board. You can use any other microcontroller as well. The basic concepts are same for all microcontrollers. Before we works on the microcontroller, we need to know about it.
